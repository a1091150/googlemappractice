# googlemappractice

## Features I use:
1.	Swift language and ios device.
2.	Google Map sdk on ios platform for representing the View of Map.
3.	Google Direction api for drawing and finding a route between google map markers.

## Some Setting:
1.	Editing the pod file to reinstall google map sdk.
2.	Replace the string "YOURAPIKEY" to your google api key by ( âŒ˜ + F ) searching.

The project does not use Google map Geocoding api, bacause only one api request per day without credit card...
